# Custom ELT Project

This repository contains a custom Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) project that utilizes Docker and PostgreSQL to demonstrate a simple ELT process.


1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the repository directory and run `docker-compose up`.
4. Once all containers are up and running, the ELT process will start automatically.
5. After the ELT process completes, you can access the source and destination PostgreSQL databases on ports 5433 and 5434, respectively.
